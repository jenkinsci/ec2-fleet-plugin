Specify maximum time which Jenkins will wait for EC2 instance startup before
trying to request new instance from fleet.

<p>
    By default Jenkins expect that node will be available immediately, however EC2 instance
    requires some time to be provision, start and be ready for actual builds. In result
    Jenkins might request more capacity then actually required (over-provision). This setting
    avoids over-provision by force Jenkins to wait until EC2 instance will be online and
    don't request more capacity.
</p>

<p>
    In case of positive value, will force Jenkins to wait when EC2 instance will be online,
    no more then specified time in seconds. Cannot be negative.
    In case of <code>0</code>, timeout will be disabled and Jenkins will
    not wait any time to start up EC2 instance, which could lead to over-provision.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Note</b> Be careful with very big values (more 5 min) for this settings. In case of any problem
    with node (no java, wrong version of java, Jenkins agent cannot start), so it cannot be online.
    Jenkins will wait, without requesting additional capacity.

<p>
    Behavior of previous versions of plugin could be represented as this version
    with timeout set to <code>0</code>.
