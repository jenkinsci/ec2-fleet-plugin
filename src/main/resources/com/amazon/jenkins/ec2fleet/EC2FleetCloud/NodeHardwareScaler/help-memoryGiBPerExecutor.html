<p>Used to set the number of executors based on the Node's memory(GiB)</p>

<div>
  <p>Number of Executors =
    <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" mathsize="1em">
      <mfrac>
          <ms>GiB of memory</ms>
          <ms>Memory(GiB) Per Executor</ms>
      </mfrac>
    </math>
  </p>
</div>

<p>For example, if an EC2 Instance with 8GiB of memory is used as a Node, and the Memory(GiB) Per Executor is set to 2, then
the number of executors will be set to 4.</p>
