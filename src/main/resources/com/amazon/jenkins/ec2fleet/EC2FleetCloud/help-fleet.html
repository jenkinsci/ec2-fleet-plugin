Select the fleet which will be used to launch Jenkins workers. EC2 Spot Fleet and Auto Scaling Group
are both supported.
<p>
    By default, this list only includes active
    EC2 Spot Fleets and Auto Scaling Groups. If you need to see all fleets,
    click the checkbox below. The selected fleet will be in the list regardless of fleet state.

    <b>EC2 Spot Fleet specific:</b> All non <code>maintain</code> type fleets will be filtered out from this list.

        about types</a>.

    If you are not sure about your fleet type, check its type via an API call or look in the console UI for
    <code>Maintain Target Capacity</code> being enabled.

    <b>AWS Permissions: </b> The plugin requires certain AWS permissions for managing resources. You can check missing permissions by clicking the <b>Test Connection</b> button.
    The Test Connection button does not validate certain listed permissions such as TerminateInstances and UpdateAutoScalingGroup due to API restrictions.
    Check out the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-fleet-plugin/blob/master/README.md">README</a> for an inline IAM Policy.
