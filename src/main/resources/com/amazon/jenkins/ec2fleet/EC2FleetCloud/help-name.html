<div>
    Provide a name for this EC2 Fleet Cloud

    <p>
        Could be used in Groovy as cloud identifier.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Note</b> Due to Jenkins organization.
        Build Executor Status section in Jenkins UI could show old cloud name
        for slaves, to fix that just wait when slaves will be recreated (could be long)
        or delete slave (will not delete underline EC2 instances).
        It will request plugin to recreate slaves with correct cloud name.
