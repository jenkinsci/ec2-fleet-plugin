<p>Used to set the number of executors based on the Node's memory(GiB)</p>

<div>
    <p>Number of Executors =
        <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" mathsize="1em">
            <mfrac>
                <ms>Number of vCPUs</ms>
                <ms>vCPU(s) Per Executor</ms>
            </mfrac>
        </math>
    </p>
</div>

<p>For example, if an EC2 Instance with a vCPU count of 8 is used as a Node, and the vCPU(s) Per Executor is set to 4, then
    the number of executors will be set to 2.</p>
