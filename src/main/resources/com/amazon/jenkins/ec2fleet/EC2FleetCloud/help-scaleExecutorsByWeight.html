If unchecked, which is default, plugin will not use
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html#spot-instance-weighting">instance
    weight</a>
information to scale the number of executors per node. Instead, Jenkins will just use the number of executors defined in
configuration field <code>Number of Executors</code>.

<p>
    When checked, the plugin consumes instance weight information provided by a Launch Specification
    and uses it to scale the node's number of executors from configuration field <code>Number of Executors</code>.
    <b>Note:</b> current implementation doesn't support Launch Template, only Launch Specification.
</p>

<p>
    Example (here instance type from launch specification matches with
    launched instance type):

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Number of Executors</th>
        <th>Instance Weight</th>
        <th>Effective<br>Number of Executors</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0.5</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0.1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>0.1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1.5</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1.44</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
</p>

<p>
    Plugin always set number of executors to <b>at least one</b>.
    If the launched instance type doesn't match any weight in launch specification,
    regular number of executors will be used without any scaling.
