Enable no delay provision strategy.
<p>
    Disabled by default.
</p>
<p>
    Enabling of this setting will disable default Jenkins behavior for particular cloud
    and ask this cloud to provision new agents almost as soon as new jobs appear in queue.
</p>
<p>
    When this option is disable (by default).
    Each time when Jenkins doesn't have enough agent to execute all jobs in a queue.
    Jenkins starts provision of new agents. Default strategy is trying to keep amount of agents
    as small as possible. It waits a little bit until queue will not reach some limit or
    jobs in a queue will not reach some age. As result before scheduled job will be executed you can
    see some delay.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Note</b> Enabling of this setting could increase chance of over provision, because of that
    make sure that your <code>Max Idle Minutes Before Scaledown</code> has expected value so
    free capacity could be scale in. While Linux capacity billing per minute, Windows capacity
    billing per hour, so be careful with this option.
