EC2 instance online check script.

<p>
    Allow you to provide script which will be executed on a EC2 instance to check if instance is
    ok for Jenkins tasks. Could be useful when you need to wait until <a

    By default is empty, in this case plugin will ignore script and assume EC2 instance as ready
    immediately when SSH connection established.
    <b>It doesn't guarantee that user data execution is finished.</b>
</p>

<p>
    In case if field provided (not empty). Plugin will block Jenkins tasks for this node until
    SSH connection is established and script executed with exit code <code>0</code>
    If script fail, plugin will try to execute script again with some internal until exit code is <code>0</code>
    or max time reached (configured in <i>Maximum Init Connection Timeout in sec</i>). If max time
    reached but script still fails plugin enable Jenkins tasks.
