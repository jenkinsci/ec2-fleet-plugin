Enable no delay provision strategy.
<p>
    Disabled by default.
</p>
<p>
    Enabling this setting will disable default Jenkins behavior for a particular cloud
    and ask this cloud to provision new agents almost as soon as new jobs appear in the queue.
</p>
<p>
    When this option is disabled (by default):
    Each time Jenkins doesn't have enough agents to execute all jobs in a queue,
    Jenkins starts provisioning new agents. The default strategy tries to keep the amount of agents
    as small as possible. Jenkins waits a little bit until the number of jobs in the queue reaches some limit or
    jobs in the queue reach some age. As a result, before a scheduled job will be executed you can
    see some delay.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Note:</b> Enabling this setting can increase the chance of over-provisioning. Because of that,
    make sure that your <code>Max Idle Minutes Before Scaledown</code> is set so that
    free capacity can be scaled in. While Linux capacity is billed per minute, Windows capacity
    is billed per hour, so be careful with this option.
