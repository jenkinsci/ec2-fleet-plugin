    Provide a name for this Fleet Cloud/Fleet Label Cloud. If no name is provided, then a default of 'FleetCloud' for a FleetCloud or 'FleetCloudLabel' for a FleetLabelCloud will be used for the name.

    <p>
        Could be used in Groovy as cloud identifier.
    </p>

        <b>Note:</b> Due to Jenkins organization,
        Build Executor Status section in Jenkins UI could show old cloud name
        for agents. To fix that, just wait until agents are recreated (could be long)
        or delete the agent (will not delete underlying EC2 instances).
        Deleting an agent will cause the plugin to recreate it with correct cloud name.
