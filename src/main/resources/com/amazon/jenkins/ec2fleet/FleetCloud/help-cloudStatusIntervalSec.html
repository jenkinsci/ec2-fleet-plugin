<div>
    Set the interval for checking the EC2 clouds status.
    <p>
        Every check fetches the current state of the cloud from EC2 and scales the size of the cloud up or down.
    </p>
    <p>
        Longer intervals will reduce the number of EC2 API calls, shorter intervals will allow the cloud to faster scale up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>The default is to check every 10 seconds.</b>
    </p>
