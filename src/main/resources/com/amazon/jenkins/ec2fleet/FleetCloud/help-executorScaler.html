<p>Plugin always set number of executors to <b>at least one</b>.<p></p>
<h5>No Scaling</h5>
<p>Doesn't scale. Uses set number of executors</p>

<h5>Scale by node hardware</h5>
<p>Determine number of executors by node hardware: Memory and vCPU count. Specify the quantity of each resource to be
    allocated per executor. The plugin sources the resources of the node and calculates the desired number of executors.
    The lower number of executors calculated will be chosen to prevent over provisioning.
</p>

<h5>Scale by weight</h5>

<p>
    The plugin consumes <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html#spot-instance-weighting">instance
    weight</a> information provided by a Launch Specification
    and uses it to scale the node's number of executors from configuration field <code>Number of Executors</code>.
    <b>Note:</b> current implementation doesn't support Launch Template, only Launch Specification.
</p>

<p>
    Example (here instance type from launch specification matches with
    launched instance type):

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Number of Executors</th>
        <th>Instance Weight</th>
        <th>Effective<br>Number of Executors</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0.5</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>0.1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>0.1</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1.5</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1.44</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
</p>

<p>
    If the launched instance type doesn't match any weight in launch specification,
    regular number of executors will be used without any scaling.
